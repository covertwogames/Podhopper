/**
 * Syncs playback position and completion across devices (phone and car) through Supabase.
 *
 * This restores the cross device resume behaviour that worked in the AntennaPod build, with no
 * dependency on Pocket Casts servers. Two pulls (when the playback service starts, and when the
 * app comes to the foreground) and four pushes (a periodic sample while playing, an immediate push
 * on pause, an immediate push on service shutdown, and an explicit completion push on natural
 * finish or manual mark-as-played) keep both surfaces in step.
 *
 * Completion is an explicit fact, not a guess. A finish writes completed=true to the row; the
 * receiver runs a real local mark-as-played (removes from Up Next and auto-archives per the
 * podcast's settings), so finishing on one device removes the episode on the other.
 *
 * Protection rules, both about not destroying newer local state:
 *  - A remote change older than this device's own last change to the episode is ignored, so a
 *    stale row can never rewind your progress or undo a newer local completion.
 *  - The episode actively playing on this device right now is never overwritten.
 *
 * Reliability: the pull drains every page in one open, advances its cursor only after a page is
 * accounted for, and parks rows for episodes not yet in the local database in a small retry list
 * (so a position is never lost just because its feed had not refreshed yet). A fresh sign-in
 * starts from "now" instead of replaying the whole history.
 *
 * Install id, the last pull cursor, and the retry list live in a dedicated SharedPreferences file
 * so nothing here touches the shared app Settings.
